        <p>
            The theme of the day reminds us of the importance of coming together to learn, share, and grow.
            It encourages us to reflect on our actions and make positive changes that can create a better future.
            Each day brings new opportunities, and this theme inspires us to use them wisely —
            to show kindness, spread awareness, and make a meaningful difference in our lives and in the world around
            us.

        <h1>Night Theme</h1>
        <p>
            The theme of the night reminds us that even in darkness, there is beauty, peace, and reflection.
            Night brings a time to pause, rest, and think about the day that has passed.
            It teaches us that calmness and silence can be powerful, helping us recharge for new beginnings.
            The night inspires dreams, hope, and inner strength — reminding us that every darkness is followed by light.
